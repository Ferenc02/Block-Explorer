# Project Description

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive blockchain explorer tool. The platform allows users to browse the latest blocks on a ethereum blockchain, view detailed block and transaction information, search for blocks and addresses, and send transactions. It aims to offer a user-friendly interface for interacting with blockchain data and performing various blockchain-related tasks efficiently with their local ganache server.

## Features

### üîç Block Explorer

- Browse the latest blocks on the blockchain
- View detailed block information (hash, timestamp, transactions)
- Search for blocks by block height or block hash
- View wallets, transactions, and other details for each block

### üí∏ Transaction Analysis

- Search and view detailed transaction information
- Track transaction status and confirmations

### üì¨ Address Lookup

- Search for blockchain addresses
- View balance and transaction history for addresses

### üí∞ Send Money

- Send transactions to any blockchain address
- Monitor the status of your sent transactions
- View transaction fees and estimated confirmation times

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Blockchain**: ethers.js, ganache
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit testing and test-driven development (TDD)
- **Node.js**: npm-run-all for running multiple scripts concurrently.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ferenc02/Block-Explorer
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd block-explorer
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development environment:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start Vite and Ganache.

   If there are errors related to tailwind styles, install the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

5. If you want to populate the blockchain with random transactions, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run generateTransactions
   ```

   This will populate the blockchain with 20 random transactions. Can be changed in the script (Note: You have to run this command in parallel with the development environment.)

6. Run vitest to run the test cases:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   This will run the test cases and display the results in the terminal. (Note: The test cases will only run if the ganache server is started.)

## Usage

- **PostCSS**: Styles are automatically compiled and updated when you modify the `src/styles.css` file or add any Tailwind classes in the HTML.
- **Tailwind**: The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which is why vite is used for this project.
- **ethers.js**: Interacts with the Ethereum blockchain, used for fetching block and transaction data.
- **Ganache**: Serves as a local blockchain for development and testing, available at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.
- **Vite**: Serves the project on `http://localhost:5173/` and provides hot module replacement for a smooth development experience while also compiling the typescript.

- **Vitest**: Runs the test cases and displays the results in the terminal.
